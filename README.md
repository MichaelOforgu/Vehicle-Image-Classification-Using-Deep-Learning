# Project Overview
In the modern world, vehicle image classification has become an essential task for a range of applications, particularly in areas like autonomous vehicles, traffic monitoring, and smart parking solutions. With the rise of automated systems, the ability to accurately recognize and classify vehicles based on images has significant implications for improving traffic management, optimizing parking space allocation, and enhancing overall road safety.

However, accurately classifying vehicles from images poses several challenges. Vehicles come in many different shapes, sizes, and models, with varying appearance and design across regions. Furthermore, environmental factors such as lighting, weather, and road conditions can significantly affect the quality of images, making it difficult to achieve consistent classification. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a deep learning model capable of classifying vehicles into two categories: cars and motorcycles, based on their images.

# Steps Taken
## Data Collection and Preparation
The first critical step in developing the vehicle classification model was to gather an appropriate dataset. A diverse collection of vehicle images was sourced, containing images of both cars and motorcycles. The dataset included images captured under various lighting conditions, from different angles, and in diverse settings. This diversity ensured that the model would be exposed to a wide range of real-world conditions.

Once the dataset was obtained, it was cleaned to ensure only relevant, high-quality images were used for training. Many real-world datasets contain corrupted, low-quality, or irrelevant images that could negatively impact the model's performance. As a result, the dataset was thoroughly examined, and any image that was damaged or failed to load correctly was removed.

## Data Preprocessing
With the dataset cleaned and ready, the next step was preprocessing the data. To make the images suitable for input into the deep learning model, they were resized to a consistent shape and normalized. The pixel values of the images were scaled from a range of 0-255 to 0-1 to facilitate better convergence during model training. Image normalization is a common technique in deep learning as it standardizes input data, enabling the model to learn more effectively.

Next, the dataset was split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set comprised 70% of the total images, which would be used to train the model. The validation set, which accounted for 20% of the data, was used to monitor the model’s performance during training and to tune hyperparameters. Finally, the remaining 10% was reserved for testing, allowing the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen images to be evaluated.

# Building the Deep Learning Model
The model architecture was built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have proven to be highly effective for image classification tasks. CNNs automatically learn features from images through layers that convolve and pool the data. The model consisted of several convolutional layers designed to extract relevant features from the input images, followed by max-pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and increase computational efficiency.

Once the feature extraction was complete, the model included dense layers to make the final classification between the two vehicle classes: cars and motorcycles. TensorFlow and Keras, which provide high-level APIs for developing deep learning models, were used to design and train the model. The choice of CNN for this task was based on its proven success in image-related tasks, particularly in computer vision applications.

## Model Compilation and Training
After defining the model architecture, the next step was model compilation. The Adam optimizer was chosen due to its efficiency in adjusting the model’s weights during training. The binary cross-entropy loss function was used because this is a binary classification task, distinguishing between two vehicle types: cars and motorcycles. With the model compiled, training began.

The model was trained on the training dataset for several epochs, during which it learned to recognize patterns in the images. While training, the model’s performance was evaluated using the validation set to track its progress. If necessary, adjustments to hyperparameters were made to improve performance. Additionally, real-time monitoring of the training process was performed using TensorBoard, which provided insights into the loss and accuracy metrics during training.

### Plot Model Performance (Loss and Accuracy)
To evaluate how well the model is learning, the training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted over the course of the epochs. This visual representation helps to assess whether the model is improving over time or if it’s overfitting to the training data. By observing the trends in these plots, adjustments can be made to the model or the training process to improve performance.

## Evaluate Model Performance
Once the model has been trained, its performance is evaluated using the test dataset. This step is crucial to determine how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. The model’s accuracy and loss on the test set are computed, providing insights into how well it would perform in a real-world application.

## Test Model
In addition to evaluating the model on the test set, the model is also tested on individual images. New images, which the model has not seen before, are passed through the network to predict whether the vehicle is a car or a motorcycle. This step ensures that the model can make accurate predictions on real-world data.

## Saving and Deployment
After achieving satisfactory performance, the model was saved for future use. TensorFlow’s model.save() function was used to save the trained model, ensuring that it could be reloaded later without requiring retraining. The saved model can now be deployed in real-time applications, where it can classify vehicles based on images captured by cameras. The model is also flexible enough to be updated with new data over time, ensuring its continued effectiveness as the dataset grows.

# Results
The deep learning model demonstrated impressive performance, achieving an accuracy rate above 90% on the test set. This indicates that the model was able to classify vehicles into the correct categories (cars or motorcycles) with high precision, even under varying conditions. The test results also highlighted the model’s ability to generalize well to unseen images, a critical factor for real-world applications.

The model’s performance was further validated by evaluating its predictions on individual images, where it consistently classified the vehicles correctly. This suggests that the model is robust and capable of handling real-world data effectively.

# Conclusion
The project successfully developed a deep learning-based model capable of classifying vehicles into two categories: cars and motorcycles. By utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced deep learning techniques, the model demonstrated high accuracy and generalization, making it suitable for real-world applications. The model was built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras, with GPU acceleration ensuring efficient training and performance.
